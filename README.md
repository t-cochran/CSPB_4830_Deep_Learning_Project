# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
*CSPB 4830 Machine Learning - Summer 2022*

* Author: Thomas Cochran

__Project Description__

* The goal of this project is to build and train convolutional neural networks that can classify scenic images.

__Problem Type__

* This is a supervised multi-class classification problem. We will be training our models using labeled images corresponding to scenic locations, e.g. streets, buildings, mountains, oceans, or forests. 

__Project Motivation__

* The primary motivator of this project is to learn more about building, training, and optimizing convolutional neural networks for image classification. This is useful for processing an ever increasing amount of image data generated by social media, smartphones, and IoT.


<sub>**Note:** The notebook for this project was written in the [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) environment. Each model was trained using GPUs provided by google collab. </sub>
